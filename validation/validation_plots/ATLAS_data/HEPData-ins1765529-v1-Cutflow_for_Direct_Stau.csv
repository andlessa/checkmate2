#: name: Cutflow for Direct Stau
#: description: Cutflow for two reference points (${\tilde{\tau}}^{+}_{R,L} {\tilde{\tau}}^{-}_{R,L}$ production) in SR. The column labelled $N_{weighted}$ shows the results including all correction factors applied to simulation, and is normalised to 139 fb$^{-1}$, while $N_{raw}$ in brackets shows the results for the generated number of events. The quoted uncertainties are statistical only. The "Generator filter" includes the requirements that two $\tau$ in the event have ${p}_{T} > 15$ GeV and $|\eta| <$ 2.6. The "Baseline Cut" includes the requirement of two baseline $\tau$ with a minimum value at 0.01 of the boosted decision tree discriminant (JetBDTSigTransMin $>$ 0.01) and ${p}_{T, \tau_{1}} > 50$ GeV and ${p}_{T, \tau_{2}} > 40$ GeV. At the step "Trigger & offline cuts", the following requirements are applied: the event is recorded using the asymmetric di-$\tau$ trigger (di-$\tau$ $E_{T}^{miss}$ trigger) in SR-lowMass (SR-highMass), and the lepton $p_{T}$ and $E_{T}^{miss}$ are required at plateau.
